### Description

This is an implementation of the classic French card racing game, MilleBornes. I was looking for one here and on the net and couldn&#8217;t find the source, so I wrote some of my own. I&#8217;ve been working on this off-and-on for about four years now. Well, not really four years, because two and a half years ago, my computer got struck by lighting and I lost my HDD and had to start over. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s finished. Rules and instructions on how to play are included inside the application.
